# Call the create_app function to get the Flask application instance
# This function typically sets up the app with necessary configurations,
# registers blueprints, and initializes extensions like databases

# The following block of code ensures that the Flask application runs only if
# this script is executed directly, and not when it is imported as a module

    # Start the Flask development server
    # Setting debug=True enables the debugger, allows for automatic reloading
    # of the server upon code changes, and provides detailed error messages
