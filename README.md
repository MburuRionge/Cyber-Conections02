		Cyber Connections
This is a portfolio project aimed to refine and sharpen my skills on Software engineering with the aim to showcase my skills to future potential employers.

The project aims to solve or be part of the solution of cyber insecurity targetting organizations.

This  project connects organizations to cyber security firms and sources cyber security experts.

The first step to secure your organization is by going to our website and registering your organization. Inside the app you will have access to all cyber security firms and experts that are on near your location and all their information.

Your organization will have the priviledge of accessing this information instantly thus reducing time and cost expenses. You will have the opportunity to coose and pick the best firm to patner with based on  their prices and services offered.

Our contribution to the insecurity caused by cyber crimes is by providing a platform where organizations can select a cyber -security firm to patner with.

Now that is a spell for disaster to small countries like Kenya that lack resources to invest and tackle this emerging problem which is a very big security issue to companies operating in Kenya. My aim is to build a platform that helps tacke this huge massive problem.

My focus is to be part of the solution by connecting organizations with cyber-security firms in atimely manner and also offer multiple options to choose from.

Inside the platform organizations will access cyber security firms with their details in terms of price, location and size thus reducing the amount of time and cost it takes for organizations to find a suitable patner well suited for its operations.

This is my first solo project, which I built it in two weeks time.I worked on both front-end and back-end of my application, intergrating different technologies with the aim of creating a well functioning app that is web and mobile friendly, while outsourcing reliable and sophisticated API.

My father took me to a theatre to watch a movie when I was in high school. This was the first time I went to a movie theatre or had to spend time with my father who was always working. At first I couldn’t believe him, I thought he was joking.

Men are struggling to cope with the modern world. Before industrialization, men stayed at home and taught their kids what he knew through immitation and apprenticeship, but today their place and apresence at home is absent. They spend all their time at work, far away from home.

They come back home tired making them to be out of touch with their family. A distance starts to grow between them and their family making them be an alien to his family. A very difficult time and my father wasn’t an exception either.

So when he suggested we go out, that took me by suprise as I had not seen him for more than a week and now here he is.My mixed emotions couldn’t understand so we headed out to a movie thatre and the movie that we watched was about a hacker who took down a who brought an organization to its knees by blackmailing it to send money in exchange of its data and returning its operations back online.

When I look back that was the beginning of my interest in Cyber Security, but lack of resources and learning opportunity kept me back. Inorder to learn this skills one had to go out of the country, hence it was for the priviledged few.

This made me throw away my chances of entering into this industry until I got a scholarship in 2023 May 09 when I enrolled into ALX to pursue a course in Software Engineering a very rare opportunity, a course am still pursuing.

Now this kickstarted my interest into this industry where an tilting towards. My first move is to use this new skills that I have acquired and start making an impact into this industry and thats where Cyber Connections comes into the picture.


A user(organization or cyber-security firm) can access the website using any browser and from the browser they send a get request to my server. The user’s request is taken to the one of the web servers which responds with a login in or sign up request. The user responds by either login in or signing up, his/her information is stored in the database.

Inside the home page the user post’s its details of the company thus making it easier for the two sides to meet. An eaxample is the cyber securit firm gives information about its cost, location, services offered and all that information is stored inside the website database.

When an organization is in need of of a cyber security, it navigates to the search button and sends get request to access the cyber security companies and choose the best suited firm to patner with. The request is sent to the database, parses through it and fetches the list of cyber security firms with their details.

The organization is then redirected to anothe page that contains the name, contact information and details of the cyber security firms, Thus fulfilling my goal of connecting them to cyber security firm. The organization chooses and contacts the cyber security firm best suited to patber with hence reducing the amount of time, cost and resources used to find a cyber security firm.

For Frontend development I chose to use technologies like Javacsript which enables a user to interact with my website, CSS for styling my website and HTML which provided the templates to work on.For backend I have majorly worked with Python, Javascript and Flask framework and SQL to store my data.

The features in the website are;

Feature: The website is responsive and compatible with mobile. This means users can access the project from a mobile view!
The website has a unique logo.A functionality that has a value for the user.
The website has a navigation bar that allows users to access different features inside the website.
The difficult challenge came to deploying my application website. I had installed Nginx and Gunicorn to ease the problem of deployment but still this a big issue. Time had passed while trying to intergrate different features in my website which left me with 27 hours only for my project. I reached out to my 4 of my peers and the technical staff. It was tough as my peers and technical staff were from other countries, so finding time to meet and explain my issue was difficult.

They sent documentaries and you tube videos and recommended to me to go through them. This got me off the ground but the problem is that I didn’t have enough time to go through the material, This was a race against time. The problem is that I wasn’t using a virtal environment and was using a root user for production. A very grave and costly mistake.

One of my technical staff was the one that highlited that issue in the and warned me to check it. The moment I noticed this error I hurried to add a new user where I shifted all my work to and after 3 to 4 trials I was able to follow all the steps in the documentaries and everything worked out.

The technical take-aways I learned throughout the project phase, are;

Test your project as you proceed building your website, don’t wait till the end of the project.
Adding features is the easy part, integrating the deatures inside the app is the worst nightmare an engineer could have.
Use documentaries as often as you can. Reasearch how a method, function, class works before using it.
If am told to repeat this project again I would dedicate alot of time researching and planning before I commit myself to anything.

I have come to learn its best practice first to whiteboard my code before writing it. I can hear you screaming at me as you read this article that this is tiring, and I agree with you, but it works wonders. It enables me as an engineer not only to think but also to visualize as Icode what I want my code to achieve.

I have been able to analyse myself through thos project, I have come to learn my strengths and weaknesses. In technologies like python and working with Flask framework and SQL wasn’t only fun but this were my strengths. All I need is to refine my skills and perfect them. I do have a big problem with Integrating features with Javascript where I need o do more exercises.

Actually I have come to realise combining Python and SQL is much easier than I actually thought. Configuring files is a bit trickier and one should be very careful, An error can cause so much damage. Intergrating different features consumes a lot of time, practicing will refine my skills.I look foward to conquoring this challenge, A very exciting journey ahead of me.

This is my first project that I have completed, the first time am making an idea a reality. This is a very interesting journey, one that engineers are proud of themselves and their work. It was extremely tough guys, not an easy task at all, but rhis is the first project that I have done in less than a month. Its not perfect, to consider it good is an encouragement but am looking foward to the journey ahead of me.

I am a student studying softaware engineering at ALX Africa, a scholarship program that has the goal to equip more than 3 million people with digital ready skills by 2035 and am blessed to be counted among one of the beneficiaries of this program in Africa. I thank everyone who is part and parcel of the program for building a generation and giving hope to Africa.
